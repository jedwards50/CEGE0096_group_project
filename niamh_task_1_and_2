# CEGE0096 - 2nd Assignment (Group Programming Project)
# Task 1 & 2 - Drafts

# The ideas of making those codes mainly referred to the lecture slides and Jupyter Notebook notes.
# Official tutorials of used python packages were also referred.
# This software should be run with the given materials, some packages for GIS will need to be imported
# before running this project.


# 0.1 - Import required packages for the following steps
import os
import numpy as np
import rasterio
from rasterio import mask, plot, windows
from shapely.geometry import Point, Polygon
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# 0.2 - Title for the software and its background:
print("**** CEGE0096 Assignment 2 - Flood Emergency Planning - Dragonfly (0.1) ****")

# Task 1. User Input.
# In this task, this software should:
# Ask the user to input their current location as a British National Grid coordinate (easting and northing).
# Test whether the user is within a box (430000, 80000) and (465000, 95000).

# 1.0 - Introduction

# 1.1 - Let the user input the easting and northing and test whether the point is in the testing area
# Notice: the easting and northing should follow the style of British National Grid
